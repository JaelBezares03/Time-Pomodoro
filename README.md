# Time Pomodoro
 This project consists of a Pomodoro-style timer developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to set work and break intervals, with start, pause, and reset buttons for time control. The interface is designed with CSS for an appealing appearance, while JavaScript handles the timer logic and interface updates.
