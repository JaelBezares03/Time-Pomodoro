The project involves creating an interactive timer based on the Pomodoro technique, which divides time into work and break intervals. Users can set the time for the work session and break.

HTML is used to structure the timer interface, including start, pause, and reset buttons, as well as visualizations of the remaining time for work and break. Additionally, the project includes a to-do list feature to enhance productivity.

CSS is used to style and design the timer interface, including the appearance of buttons, background, and other visual elements to enhance the user experience.

Finally, JavaScript is used for timer logic, controlling time counting, transitioning between work and break sessions, updating the user interface accordingly, and managing the to-do list functionality.
